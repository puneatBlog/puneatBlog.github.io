          <p>We have all learned that the density of air is lower at higher altitudes. But why exactly is that? We’ll begin with the basics.
Density is an important property of any gas, which includes our air. It is defined as the mass of an object divided by its volume.</p>

          <p><span>$$D={M \over V}$$</span>
            <span>
              Where, <br>
              $$D = Density$$
              $$M = Mass$$
              $$V = Volume$$

            </span>
          </p>

          <p>However, most of our experiences with density involve solids. We have already seen objects that are heavier than other objects, even though they are the same size.</p>

          <p>Do you remember that trick question we used to ask our friends- ‘What is heavier, 1kg of steel or 1 kg of a feather?’. Of course, they’re both equally heavy, with both having a weight of 1kg. But as steel is denser, we can fit 1kg of steel in the palm of our hands but it’ll probably take an entire room to fill 1kg worth of feathers.</p>

          <p>For solids, because the molecules are bound to one another, the density of an object remains almost the same anywhere. A brick at the sea-level would have the same density as the same brick on top of the Mt. Everest. But when we deal with gases, density can vary widely, as the molecules are free to move about. Air at the surface of the earth has a very different density than air 50 kilometres above the earth.</p>

          <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

          <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
