          <p align="justify">Let me begin by stating outright that I don’t believe in god. I don’t buy the entire concept of a ‘higher being’ or a 'form of energy’. A lot of people do, but the last time a lot of people were convinced of an idea, we had World War 2. That said, I do recognise the beliefs of other people, and I respect them (as long as I don’t have to participate). Of course, if you ever want to debate (read: argue) on this topic, let me know.</p>

          <p align="justify">Anyway, moving on now. Sufism has been defined as ‘Islamic mysticism’ which has its roots deeply entrenched in the concept of god or ‘Allah’. Of course, Sufism is more about the devotion or the belief in Allah. In short, Sufism is about spirituality and god, which may seem like something people who believe in god would be more inclined towards.
          </p>

          <p align="justify">However, I somehow, for reasons unknown to me, am fascinated by Sufi music and poetry. The works of Rumi, Hafiz, Amir Khusrow, Nusrat-Fateh Ali Khan, Junoon, and even A.R. Rahman have always had a deep impact on me. Now, what that impact exactly is, its difficult to explain. But anytime I hear Sufi music, I simply go silent and start reflecting. Reflecting on the lyrics and the feeling of the music.</p>

          <p align="justify">The way Tajdar-e-haram talks about,
            <br><br>
            <b><i>
            Qismat mein meri chain se jeena likh de<br>
 Doobe naa kabhi mera safeena likh de</i></b><br><br>
Who wouldn’t want that right? A peaceful life without minimal lows. Or consider the following verse,
<br><br>
<b><i>
  Koyi apna nahin gham ke maare hain ham<br>
 Aap ke dar pe faryaad laaye hain ham<br><br>
</i></b>

We have no one to call our own and are full of sadness. Which is why we are coming to you to end this misery. In the entire song, it’s probably these lines which hold the answer to the question as to why an atheist would be impacted by this song. The answer is that its not really about god. It can be anyone. Any human even. What it is about finding someone that you can approach who can at least make the pain or the lows bearable. One who holds your hand and tells you that keep fighting. It’s the person that you know is going to be there the entire way and will never abandon you, is who God is.

</p>

          <p align="justify">
            One could argue that why does it have to be another person; why can’t it be the person themselves. I would say that consider a boat sailing in the ocean. There are 2 people in this boat – you steering the boat and a captain. You have absolute trust in this captain, that even if you fall in the deep waters, this person will save you. Now, remember, this person doesn’t actively help you but is there in the boat. He will answer your questions, calm you when you get anxious and help you if you ask for it. Even if the boat encounters a storm, you ride it out and keep rowing, with the knowledge that even if the boat sinks, this other person will save you. And even if the captain cannot do anything, at least you weren’t alone during the storm. That belief in the abilities of that other person is what keeps you from giving up. Because if you were alone and your boat was sinking, you might try to swim or try to survive but 99% of the times, you would give up eventually and drown. Because no matter how ‘independent’ you are, if the storm lasts long enough, you will eventually give in. If the sharks don’t get you, loneliness and your fragile mind will get you.
          </p>

          <p align="justify">
            Which is probably why I love Sufi songs. Because almost all of them talk about this person. The god. The Allah. Since my childhood, I have always felt as if I was alone. With no one to help me but me. and I did survive for 21 years. Of course, there have been several (read: 3) people in my life that I’ve felt could be my ‘god’. But of course, blame me or life, it was never to be. Constant shifting around the country ensured that friendships or love was something that I always considered as temporary. Kind of like a rented house. You’d try to make the rented house seem like a home when you’re living in it, but once you moved out, you’d have to start over again. No wonder I have no attachments with any object. No favourite watch or apparel or toy or anything. If any personal item of mine gets lost or break, I don’t feel sad or heartbroken. <i>Naya aajayega koi nahi.</i> It might seem normal but imagine a little kid who doesn’t cry if his toy disappears or breaks. Same with friends. I never had a proper smartphone and internet was a luxury for me till 12th at least.  Which means that I don’t know where my friends from Guwahati or Kolkata are now. And I’ve forgotten their names except for some fleeting memories.
          </p>

          <p align="justify">
            Clearly, staying in touch is difficult for me. Combine that with innumerable insecurities and low self-esteem and you get a person who will probably be successful in his career but will definitely die alone. Okay, I lost track of what I was saying earlier but then isn’t that the point of a blog. Anyway, all these realisations came to me during this lockdown. When living inside a single home for 8 months with no one to meet and just the same 3 people every day, made me realise the dearth of friends I had. Friends that I could contact without thinking and anytime. Might be too much to ask maybe, but during those sleepless nights and frequent crying for 3 months, all I wanted was someone to tell me that ‘It shall be okay Puneet. It's okay’. And the person who said those things to me was, as expected, me. Reinforcing the point that only I’m there for myself. Now could I have contacted the 4 friends that I have? Yes, but I couldn’t simply because didn’t want to force myself on anyone. To subject them with my problems.
          </p>

          <p align="justify">
            All this makes me realise why Sufi songs impact me so much. Because whether I accept it or not, I am looking for my god. The God who tells me it's going to be okay. And the fact that Sufi songs manage to express what I feel and desire in a beautiful soulful manner, just makes them perfect.
